# GoGE

## What is GoGE?

GoGE is a two-dimensional, console-based game engine in Go.

## How can I use it?

Download this repository as a .zip, expand it, and rename the resulting folder from `goge-master` to `goge`. Finally, put that folder in your `go/src` folder.

## Is There Documentation?

Yes. In `goge/demos` there are some heavily commented Go programs.
